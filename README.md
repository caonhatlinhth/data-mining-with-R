**Data Mining Class Assignments**

This repository contains the code for the assignments completed during the Data Mining class. The assignments cover a range of topics related to data mining, including the use of ML models and statistical algorithms, implemented using R programming.

**Project Background**

The Data Mining class assignments focus on applying data mining techniques to real-world datasets. By utilizing R programming, ML models, and statistical algorithms, the assignments aim to explore various data mining concepts, such as data preprocessing, feature selection, clustering, classification, regression, and evaluation.

**Contents**
- Code: R scripts and notebooks containing the code for the assignments, including data preprocessing, ML model implementation, statistical algorithms, and evaluation techniques.
- Datasets: Datasets used in the assignments, including any preprocessed or derived datasets.
- Figures: Visualizations, charts, and figures generated during the analysis.
- References: Relevant research papers, articles, and resources used for the assignments.

**Assignment Topics**

The assignments cover a wide range of data mining topics, including:
- Data preprocessing techniques (cleaning, transformation, normalization, etc.).
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
- Supervised learning techniques (classification, regression) using ML models.
- Unsupervised learning techniques (clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- Feature selection and feature engineering.
- Evaluation metrics and model performance assessment.
- Statistical algorithms for data mining.
